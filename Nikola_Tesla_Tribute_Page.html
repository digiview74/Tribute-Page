          <li><b>1856-</b> Born on July 10, 1856 in the Austrian Empire</li>
          <li><b>1884-</b> Tesla came to the United States and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways</li>
          <li><b>1887-</b> Tesla found funding for his new Tesla Electric Company, and by the end of the year he had successfully filed several patents for AC-based inventions</li>
          <li><b>1888-</b> Tesla's AC system soon caught the attention of American engineer and businessman George Westinghouse, who was seeking a solution to supplying the nation with long-distance power. Convinced that Tesla's inventions would help him
            achieve this, he purchased his patents for $60,000 in cash and stock in the Westinghouse Corporation</li>
          <li><b>1891-</b> Tesla patented the "Tesla coil," which laid the foundation for wireless technologies and is still used in radio technology today. The heart of an electrical circuit, the Tesla coil is an inductor used in many early radio transmission
            antennas. The coil works with a capacitor to resonate current and voltage from a power source across the circuit. Tesla himself used his coil to study fluorescence, x-rays, radio, wireless power and electromagnetism in the earth and its atmosphere</li>
          <li><b>1895-</b> Tesla designed what was among the first AC hydroelectric power plants in the United States, at Niagara Falls. The following year, it was used to power the city of Buffalo, New York — a feat that was highly publicized throughout
            the world and helped further AC electricity’s path to becoming the world’s power system</li>
          <li><b>1900-</b> Nikola set to work on his boldest project yet: to build a global, wireless communication system — to be transmitted through a large electrical tower — for sharing information and providing free electricity throughout the world</li>
          <li><b>1901-</b> With funding from a group of investors that included financial giant J. P. Morgan, Tesla began work on the project in earnest, designing and building a lab with a power plant and a massive transmission tower on a site on Long Island,
            New York, that became known as Wardenclyffe</li>
          <li><b>1906-</b> Doubts arose among his investors about the plausibility of Tesla's system. As his rival, Guglielmo Marconi — with the financial support of Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison — continued to make great advances with his own radio technologies,
            Tesla had no choice but to abandon the project</li>
          <li><b>1915-</b> The Wardenclyffe site had fallen into foreclosure. Two years later Tesla declared bankruptcy and the tower was dismantled and sold for scrap to help pay the debts he had accrued</li>
          <li><b>1943-</b> Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, in New York City, where he had lived for nearly 60 years. After suffering a nervous breakdown following the closure of his free energy project, Tesla eventually
            returned to work, primarily as a consultant</li>

          <li><b>The Secret of Nikola Tesla-</b> a 1980 biographical film starring Orson Welles as J. P. Morgan.</li>
          <li><b>Nikola Tesla-</b> The Genius Who Lit the World, a 1994 documentary produced by the Tesla Memorial Society and the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.</li>
          <li><b>The Prestige-</b> a 2006 fictional film about two magicians directed by Christopher Nolan, with rock star David Bowie portraying Tesla.</li>
